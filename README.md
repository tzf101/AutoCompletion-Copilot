# AutoCompletion-Copilot

## Introduction

**Purpose of the Proposal:** Develop a state-of-the-art text autocomplete system using advanced NLP and ML techniques to enhance productivity and foster creativity for writers.

**Background:** Writers often encounter repetitive tasks or need to maintain consistency in their text. Our system aims to streamline these processes by offering contextually appropriate text completions.

**Project Summary:** "Intelligent Text Autocomplete CoPilot" will adapt to users' writing styles over time through the use of reinforcement learning, providing highly relevant autocomplete suggestions.

## Problem Statement

- **Current Gaps:** Many autocomplete technologies lack sensitivity to the context and do not adapt to individual user styles effectively.
- **User Pain Points:** Writers, including journalists and academics, struggle with maintaining narrative flow and managing extensive writing tasks efficiently.

## Objectives

- **Main Objectives:** Create an autocomplete system that truly understands textual context and narrative flow to enhance the writing process.
- **Specific Aims:** Improve writing efficiency, reduce repetitive strain, and enhance creative expression across various writing platforms.

### Algorithm Selection and Development
- Employ NLP and ML algorithms optimized for contextual understanding.
- Develop and train a 4-bit quantized model using the `gemma2b` framework to ensure high prediction accuracy.


## Application Scenarios

- **Browser Extension:** Universal application across web platforms.
- **Content Creation Platforms:** Integration into platforms like Medium and WordPress.
- **Email and Communication Tools:** Context-appropriate suggestions for emails and messaging.
- **Social Media and More:** Enhance engagement by suggesting relevant content and responses.
